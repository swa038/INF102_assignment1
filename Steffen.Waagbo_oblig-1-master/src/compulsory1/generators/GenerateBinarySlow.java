/**
 * Creates Job file with Jobs distributed at random around 2 points
 * The timing of the Jobs is evenly spaced and alternates between the two centers.
 * 
 * A good strategy would be to station each Robot in each of the centers and wait for a job.
 * 
 * The optimal strategy is actually to send both robots back and forth between the two centers
 * (you would need to send the robot before the job is made available to reach in time) 
 * since the time between each job is large enough to reach the other center.
 * Once at a center they can wait on two strategic points on opposite sides of the center.
 * But this strategy relies on knowledge specific to this input that and can not work in general.
